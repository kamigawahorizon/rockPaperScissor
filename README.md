This is a game where you click on a picture and then the computer chooses something too, and then you find out who wins.

There are three things to choose from: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

If you choose Rock, and the computer chooses Paper, the computer wins because paper beats rock.

If you choose Rock, and the computer chooses Scissors, you win because rock beats scissors.

If you both choose the same thing, it's a tie.

The game keeps track of how many times you and the computer have won. If you win 5 times before the computer does, you win the whole game. If the computer wins 5 times before you do, you lose the game.

The computer makes its choice randomly, and the code here helps to keep track of the score and show what you and the computer chose.
